## Overview

Machine Learning is powerful, but implementing it successfully comes with many challenges. Understanding these challenges and their solutions is crucial for building effective ML systems.

> **"Data is the new oil, but like oil, it needs to be refined to be useful."**

**[PLACEHOLDER FOR CHALLENGES OVERVIEW]**  
*Create a mind map with:*
- *Center: "ML Challenges"*
- *Branches: 9 main categories*
- *Each branch with icon and key issue*
- *Color code by severity/frequency*

## 1. Data Collection Challenges

### The Problem

**Getting the right data is often the hardest part of ML.**

Without data, you can't train models. But collecting quality data is:
- Expensive
- Time-consuming
- Sometimes impossible (privacy, access restrictions)
- Often requires domain expertise

### Common Data Collection Issues

#### 1.1 Data Doesn't Exist

```
Problem: Want to predict customer churn for new product
Issue: No historical data yet
Solution: Wait and collect data OR use similar product's data
```

#### 1.2 Data Access Restrictions

- **Privacy laws**: GDPR, HIPAA, CCPA
- **Competitive data**: Competitors won't share
- **Cost**: Data providers charge high fees
- **Legal**: Copyright, terms of service

#### 1.3 Data is Scattered

```
Customer data spread across:
- CRM system
- Website analytics
- Email platform
- Support tickets
- Social media
‚Üí Integration nightmare!
```

---

### Solutions: How to Collect Data

#### Method 1: APIs (Application Programming Interfaces)

**Pros**: Clean, structured, official access  
**Cons**: Limited data, rate limits, cost

```python
# Example: Collecting data from Twitter API
import tweepy

# Authentication
auth = tweepy.OAuthHandler(api_key, api_secret)
api = tweepy.API(auth)

# Collect tweets
tweets = api.search_tweets(q="machine learning", count=100)

for tweet in tweets:
    save_to_database(tweet.text, tweet.created_at)
```

**[PLACEHOLDER FOR API COLLECTION DIAGRAM]**  
*Show flow: Your App ‚Üí API Request ‚Üí Third-party Server ‚Üí JSON Response ‚Üí Your Database*

---

#### Method 2: Web Scraping

**Pros**: Access public data not available via API  
**Cons**: Legal gray area, fragile (websites change)

```python
# Example: Scraping product prices
from bs4 import BeautifulSoup
import requests

# Fetch webpage
url = "https://example.com/products"
response = requests.get(url)
soup = BeautifulSoup(response.content, 'html.parser')

# Extract data
products = soup.find_all('div', class_='product')
for product in products:
    name = product.find('h3').text
    price = product.find('span', class_='price').text
    save_to_database(name, price)
```

**‚ö†Ô∏è Important**: 
- Check robots.txt
- Respect terms of service
- Don't overload servers (rate limiting)
- Consider legality in your jurisdiction

---

#### Method 3: Surveys and Forms

**Pros**: Collect exactly what you need  
**Cons**: Low response rates, bias

#### Method 4: Sensors and IoT Devices

**Pros**: Continuous, objective data  
**Cons**: Hardware cost, maintenance

#### Method 5: Purchase or License Data

**Pros**: Immediate access to large datasets  
**Cons**: Expensive

#### Method 6: Data Augmentation

**Pros**: Create synthetic data from existing  
**Cons**: May not represent real distribution

```python
# Image augmentation example
from tensorflow.keras.preprocessing.image import ImageDataGenerator

datagen = ImageDataGenerator(
    rotation_range=20,      # Rotate images
    width_shift_range=0.2,  # Shift horizontally
    height_shift_range=0.2, # Shift vertically
    horizontal_flip=True,   # Flip horizontally
    zoom_range=0.2          # Zoom in/out
)

# One image ‚Üí Hundreds of variations!
```

---

## 2. Insufficient or Unlabeled Data

### The Problem

**"Do I have enough data? Is it labeled?"**

#### How Much Data Do You Need?

```
Rule of Thumb (Supervised Learning):
- Simple model: 1,000 - 10,000 samples
- Medium complexity: 10,000 - 100,000 samples  
- Deep learning: 100,000 - millions of samples

But it depends on:
- Problem complexity
- Feature dimensions
- Model type
- Data quality
```

**[PLACEHOLDER FOR DATA SIZE REQUIREMENTS CHART]**  
*Create a bar chart showing typical data needs:*
- *X-axis: Model type (Linear Regression, Random Forest, Deep Learning)*
- *Y-axis: Samples needed*
- *Color zones: Minimum, Recommended, Ideal*

---

### The Labeling Problem

**Most powerful ML algorithms (supervised) need labeled data.**

#### Labeling is Expensive

```
Example: Image Classification
- 100,000 images to label
- 30 seconds per image
- = 833 hours = $20,000+ at $24/hour

For medical images:
- Requires expert doctors
- $200+/hour
- 5 minutes per image
- = Cost skyrockets!
```

---

### Solutions for Data Scarcity

#### Solution 1: Transfer Learning

**Use models pre-trained on large datasets**

```python
# Instead of training from scratch with 1M images:
from tensorflow.keras.applications import ResNet50

# Use model pre-trained on ImageNet (14M images)
base_model = ResNet50(weights='imagenet', include_top=False)

# Fine-tune on your small dataset (1,000 images)
# Requires way less data!
model = add_custom_layers(base_model)
model.fit(your_small_dataset)
```

**[PLACEHOLDER FOR TRANSFER LEARNING VISUAL]**  
*Show:*
- *Large general dataset ‚Üí Pre-trained model*
- *Arrow to: Your small specific dataset ‚Üí Fine-tune*
- *Result: Good performance with less data*

---

#### Solution 2: Data Augmentation

Create variations of existing data

```python
# 100 images ‚Üí 1,000 images with augmentation
original_image ‚Üí [
    rotated version,
    flipped version,
    zoomed version,
    color-adjusted version,
    ...
]
```

---

#### Solution 3: Semi-Supervised Learning

**Use small labeled + large unlabeled data**

```
Labeled: 1,000 images (expensive)
Unlabeled: 100,000 images (free/cheap)

Algorithm:
1. Train on 1,000 labeled
2. Predict on 100,000 unlabeled
3. Add high-confidence predictions to training
4. Retrain
5. Repeat
```

---

#### Solution 4: Active Learning

**Let the model choose which samples to label**

```
Process:
1. Train model on small labeled set
2. Model identifies most uncertain samples
3. Human labels only those (most informative)
4. Add to training set
5. Repeat

Result: Achieve same accuracy with 50-70% less labeling!
```

**[PLACEHOLDER FOR ACTIVE LEARNING DIAGRAM]**  
*Show cycle:*
- *Model ‚Üí Identifies uncertain samples*
- *Human ‚Üí Labels only those*
- *Added to training ‚Üí Model improves*
- *Repeat*

---

#### Solution 5: Weak Supervision

**Use noisy/imperfect labels**

```python
# Instead of manual labels, use:
- Heuristics: "If title contains 'SALE', label as promotional"
- External knowledge bases
- Multiple noisy labelers (crowd-sourcing)
- Combine signals to create probabilistic labels
```

---

#### Solution 6: Synthetic Data

**Generate artificial training data**

```python
# For autonomous vehicles:
# Instead of driving millions of miles:
# Use simulators to generate synthetic scenarios
- Different weather
- Various traffic situations
- Edge cases (accidents, obstacles)
```

---

## 3. Non-Representative Data

### The Problem

**Training data doesn't represent the real-world data model will encounter.**

This is one of the most common reasons ML systems fail in production!

### Types of Non-Representative Data

#### 3.1 Sampling Bias

**Definition**: Training data systematically excludes or over-represents certain groups.

**Example 1: Medical AI**
```
Training Data: 90% male patients
Real World: 50% male, 50% female
Result: Model performs poorly on female patients
```

**Example 2: Facial Recognition**
```
Training Data: Mostly light-skinned faces
Real World: Diverse skin tones
Result: Higher error rates for dark-skinned individuals
(Real controversy with commercial systems!)
```

**[PLACEHOLDER FOR SAMPLING BIAS ILLUSTRATION]**  
*Show two pie charts:*
- *Training data distribution (skewed)*
- *Real-world distribution (balanced)*
- *Highlight the mismatch*

---

#### 3.2 Sampling Noise

**Definition**: Data contains random errors or fluctuations.

```
Example: Customer Survey
- Sample size: 50 (too small!)
- By chance, mostly unhappy customers responded
- Model learns: "Customers hate our product"
- Reality: Product is generally well-liked

Solution: Larger, random sample
```

**Small Sample Danger**:
```python
# Coin flip experiment
# Flip 10 times: Might get 7 heads, 3 tails (70% heads)
# Flip 10,000 times: Get ~50% heads, 50% tails

# Small samples can mislead!
```

---

#### 3.3 Selection Bias

**Data collection method biases the sample**

**Example: Online Survey for App**
```
Problem: Survey only shown to active users
Missing: Churned users (who had problems)
Result: Overly positive feedback
Model learns: "Everyone loves the app!"
Reality: Many users left due to issues
```

---

### Solutions for Non-Representative Data

#### Solution 1: Stratified Sampling

**Ensure each group is proportionally represented**

```python
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split

# Bad: Random split (might be unbalanced)
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y)

# Good: Stratified split (preserves class distribution)
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(
    X, y, stratify=y  # Ensures same class ratio in train/test
)
```

---

#### Solution 2: Collect More Diverse Data

```
Checklist:
‚úÖ Different geographic regions
‚úÖ Various demographic groups
‚úÖ Multiple time periods
‚úÖ Different conditions/scenarios
‚úÖ Edge cases and outliers
```

---

#### Solution 3: Resampling Techniques

```python
# Imbalanced classes: 90% Class A, 10% Class B

# Option 1: Undersample majority class
# Keep all Class B, randomly remove Class A until balanced

# Option 2: Oversample minority class  
# Keep all data, duplicate Class B samples

# Option 3: SMOTE (Synthetic Minority Over-sampling)
from imblearn.over_sampling import SMOTE

smote = SMOTE()
X_resampled, y_resampled = smote.fit_resample(X, y)
# Generates synthetic minority class examples
```

---

#### Solution 4: Weighted Training

**Give more importance to underrepresented samples**

```python
from sklearn.linear_model import LogisticRegression

# Automatically adjust weights inversely proportional to class frequencies
model = LogisticRegression(class_weight='balanced')
model.fit(X_train, y_train)

# Rare classes have higher weight in loss function
```

---

## 4. Poor Quality Data

### The Problem

> **"Garbage in, garbage out"** - oldest rule in computing

Poor quality data leads to poor models, no matter how sophisticated the algorithm.

### Types of Data Quality Issues

#### 4.1 Missing Values

**Examples**:
- Sensor malfunction ‚Üí no reading
- User skips optional form fields
- Data corruption during transfer
- Historical records incomplete

```python
# Dataset with missing values
   Age  Income  Credit_Score  Loan_Approved
0  25   50000     720          Yes
1  30   NaN       680          Yes  # Missing income
2  NaN  60000     700          No   # Missing age
3  45   80000     NaN          No   # Missing credit score
```

**Problems**:
- Most algorithms can't handle missing values (will crash)
- Ignoring rows with missing values loses information
- Pattern in missingness may be informative

---

#### 4.2 Outliers

**Definition**: Data points significantly different from others

```python
Salaries: [30k, 35k, 40k, 45k, 50k, 52k, 10,000k]
                                              ‚Üë
                                          Outlier!
                                    (CEO? Data error?)
```

**Problems**:
- Can skew statistical measures (mean, variance)
- Sensitive algorithms (linear regression, KNN) affected
- May indicate data errors OR important rare events

**[PLACEHOLDER FOR OUTLIER VISUALIZATION]**  
*Box plot showing:*
- *Normal data distribution*
- *Clear outliers marked with different color*
- *Show impact on mean vs median*

---

#### 4.3 Inconsistent Data

**Same entity, different representations**

```
Customer database:
Record 1: "New York", "NY", "10001"
Record 2: "New York City", "NY", "10001"
Record 3: "NYC", "NY", "10001"

Same city, three different strings!
```

**More examples**:
- Dates: "01/02/2024" vs "2024-02-01" vs "Feb 1, 2024"
- Names: "John Smith" vs "Smith, John" vs "J. Smith"
- Units: Miles vs Kilometers, Dollars vs Euros

---

#### 4.4 Duplicate Data

**Same sample appears multiple times**

```
Problem:
- Model sees duplicate more often
- Learns to overfit to that sample
- Validation metrics are misleading
```

---

#### 4.5 Incorrect Labels

**Humans make mistakes when labeling**

```
Image labeled as "Cat" but actually shows a dog
Email labeled as "Spam" but actually legitimate

Even experts disagree:
- Radiologists may disagree on diagnosis (5-10% of cases)
- Legal document classification subjective
```

---

### Solutions for Poor Quality Data

#### Solution 1: Data Cleaning

**Essential preprocessing step**

```python
import pandas as pd
import numpy as np

# Load data
df = pd.read_csv('data.csv')

# 1. Check for duplicates
print(f"Duplicates: {df.duplicated().sum()}")
df = df.drop_duplicates()

# 2. Check for missing values
print(df.isnull().sum())

# 3. Check data types
print(df.dtypes)

# 4. Check for outliers
print(df.describe())  # Look at min, max, std

# 5. Check for inconsistencies
print(df['country'].unique())  # See all unique values
```

---

#### Solution 2: Handling Missing Data

**Multiple strategies depending on context**:

```python
# Strategy 1: Remove rows with missing values
df_clean = df.dropna()
# Use when: Few missing values, plenty of data

# Strategy 2: Remove columns with too many missing values
df_clean = df.dropna(axis=1, thresh=0.5*len(df))
# Use when: Column has >50% missing

# Strategy 3: Imputation - Fill with mean/median
from sklearn.impute import SimpleImputer

imputer = SimpleImputer(strategy='mean')  # or 'median', 'most_frequent'
df_filled = imputer.fit_transform(df)
# Use when: Data missing randomly

# Strategy 4: Forward/Backward fill (for time series)
df_filled = df.fillna(method='ffill')  # Use previous value
# Use when: Time series, value likely similar to previous

# Strategy 5: Advanced imputation (KNN, iterative)
from sklearn.impute import KNNImputer

imputer = KNNImputer(n_neighbors=5)
df_filled = imputer.fit_transform(df)
# Use when: Relationships between features exist
```

---

#### Solution 3: Handling Outliers

```python
# Method 1: Z-score (remove if > 3 std dev from mean)
from scipy import stats

z_scores = np.abs(stats.zscore(df['salary']))
df_no_outliers = df[z_scores < 3]

# Method 2: IQR (Interquartile Range)
Q1 = df['salary'].quantile(0.25)
Q3 = df['salary'].quantile(0.75)
IQR = Q3 - Q1

# Remove outliers outside 1.5*IQR
df_no_outliers = df[
    (df['salary'] >= Q1 - 1.5*IQR) & 
    (df['salary'] <= Q3 + 1.5*IQR)
]

# Method 3: Domain knowledge
# Manually inspect and decide
# Salary > $1M might be CEO (keep) or error (remove)
```

---

#### Solution 4: Data Standardization

```python
# Standardize inconsistent values
df['country'] = df['country'].replace({
    'USA': 'United States',
    'US': 'United States',
    'U.S.': 'United States',
    'United States of America': 'United States'
})

# Standardize date formats
df['date'] = pd.to_datetime(df['date'], infer_datetime_format=True)

# Standardize text (lowercase, trim)
df['name'] = df['name'].str.lower().str.strip()
```

---

#### Solution 5: Handling Noisy Labels

```python
# Method 1: Remove suspicious labels
# If model consistently predicts differently than label, review

# Method 2: Robust loss functions
# Use loss functions less sensitive to outliers

# Method 3: Multiple annotators
# Get 3-5 people to label same data
# Use majority vote or confidence scores

# Method 4: Confident learning
# Algorithmically identify likely label errors
```

---

## 5. Irrelevant Features

### The Problem

**"Curse of Dimensionality"**

More features ‚â† Better model

**Issues with too many features**:
- Overfitting risk increases
- Training time increases
- Model complexity increases
- Some features may be noise (hurt performance)
- Harder to interpret

```
Example: Predicting house prices
Relevant features: Size, location, age, bedrooms
Irrelevant features: Owner's favorite color, day of week listed

Including irrelevant features can hurt the model!
```

---

### What is Feature Engineering?

**Feature Engineering**: The process of selecting, creating, and transforming features to improve model performance.

> **"Coming up with features is difficult, time-consuming, requires expert knowledge. Applied machine learning is basically feature engineering."** - Andrew Ng

#### Three Main Tasks:

1. **Feature Selection**: Choose which features to use
2. **Feature Extraction**: Create new features from existing ones
3. **Feature Transformation**: Transform features to better format

---

### Feature Selection Techniques

#### Method 1: Filter Methods

**Evaluate features independently of model**

```python
from sklearn.feature_selection import SelectKBest, f_classif

# Select top 10 features based on ANOVA F-value
selector = SelectKBest(score_func=f_classif, k=10)
X_selected = selector.fit_transform(X, y)

# Get selected feature names
selected_features = X.columns[selector.get_support()]
print("Selected features:", selected_features)
```

---

#### Method 2: Wrapper Methods

**Use model performance to evaluate feature subsets**

```python
from sklearn.feature_selection import RFE
from sklearn.linear_model import LogisticRegression

# Recursive Feature Elimination
model = LogisticRegression()
rfe = RFE(model, n_features_to_select=10)
X_selected = rfe.fit_transform(X, y)

# Features ranked by importance
print("Feature ranking:", rfe.ranking_)
```

---

#### Method 3: Embedded Methods

**Feature selection happens during model training**

```python
from sklearn.ensemble import RandomForestClassifier

# Random Forest has built-in feature importance
model = RandomForestClassifier()
model.fit(X, y)

# Get feature importances
importances = pd.DataFrame({
    'feature': X.columns,
    'importance': model.feature_importances_
}).sort_values('importance', ascending=False)

print(importances.head(10))  # Top 10 features

# Use only important features
important_features = importances[importances['importance'] > 0.01]['feature']
X_selected = X[important_features]
```

**[PLACEHOLDER FOR FEATURE IMPORTANCE CHART]**  
*Bar chart showing:*
- *Y-axis: Features*
- *X-axis: Importance score*
- *Color gradient: High importance (green) to low (red)*

---

### Feature Engineering Examples

#### Example 1: Creating New Features

```python
# Original features
df['date']  # Purchase date

# Create new features
df['day_of_week'] = df['date'].dt.dayofweek
df['month'] = df['date'].dt.month
df['is_weekend'] = df['day_of_week'].isin([5, 6]).astype(int)
df['is_holiday'] = df['date'].isin(holidays).astype(int)

# These new features may be more predictive!
```

---

#### Example 2: Polynomial Features

```python
# Original: Size
# Create: Size¬≤, Size¬≥

from sklearn.preprocessing import PolynomialFeatures

poly = PolynomialFeatures(degree=2, include_bias=False)
X_poly = poly.fit_transform(X)

# If X = [size, age], creates:
# [size, age, size¬≤, size√óage, age¬≤]
```

---

#### Example 3: Domain-Specific Features

```python
# For house price prediction
df['price_per_sqft'] = df['price'] / df['size']
df['room_size_avg'] = df['size'] / df['num_rooms']
df['age_category'] = pd.cut(df['age'], bins=[0, 5, 15, 50], 
                             labels=['new', 'moderate', 'old'])

# Requires domain knowledge!
```

---

## 6. Overfitting

### The Problem

**Model learns training data TOO well, including noise and outliers.**

**Analogy**: Student who memorizes answers but doesn't understand concepts.
- Aces practice exam (training data)
- Fails real exam (test data)

```
Training Accuracy: 99% ‚úì
Test Accuracy: 65% ‚úó

Problem: Overfitting!
```

**[PLACEHOLDER FOR OVERFITTING VISUALIZATION]**  
*Two graphs side-by-side:*
- *Left: Training data with very wiggly line fitting every point*
- *Right: Test data with same wiggly line performing poorly*
- *Show: Model fits training perfectly but generalizes poorly*

---

### Signs of Overfitting

```python
# Red flags:
‚úó Training accuracy >> Test accuracy (large gap)
‚úó Loss decreases on training but increases on validation
‚úó Model performs well on old data, poorly on new
‚úó Very complex model with many parameters
‚úó Training error near zero
```

---

### Causes of Overfitting

1. **Too complex model** for amount of data
   - Deep neural network for 100 samples
   - Decision tree with no depth limit

2. **Too many features** relative to samples
   - 1000 features, 500 samples
   - Model finds spurious correlations

3. **Training for too long**
   - Model starts memorizing noise

4. **Too little data**
   - Can't learn general patterns

5. **No regularization**
   - Model not penalized for complexity

---

### Solutions for Overfitting

#### Solution 1: Get More Data

**More data ‚Üí Harder to memorize ‚Üí Better generalization**

```
100 samples: Easy to memorize
10,000 samples: Much harder to memorize
Model forced to learn general patterns
```

---

#### Solution 2: Reduce Model Complexity

```python
# Decision Tree: Limit depth
tree = DecisionTreeClassifier(max_depth=5)  # Instead of unlimited

# Neural Network: Fewer layers/neurons
model = Sequential([
    Dense(32, activation='relu'),  # Instead of Dense(512)
    Dense(1, activation='sigmoid')
])

# Polynomial: Lower degree
poly = PolynomialFeatures(degree=2)  # Instead of degree=10
```

---

#### Solution 3: Regularization

**Penalize model complexity**

```python
# L1 Regularization (Lasso): Encourages sparsity
model = Lasso(alpha=0.1)  # alpha controls regularization strength

# L2 Regularization (Ridge): Shrinks weights
model = Ridge(alpha=0.1)

# Elastic Net: Combination of L1 and L2
model = ElasticNet(alpha=0.1, l1_ratio=0.5)

# Neural Networks: Add regularization layers
model = Sequential([
    Dense(64, activation='relu'),
    Dropout(0.5),  # Randomly drop 50% of neurons during training
    Dense(1, activation='sigmoid')
])
```

---

#### Solution 4: Cross-Validation

**Use data more efficiently, detect overfitting**

```python
from sklearn.model_selection import cross_val_score

# Instead of single train/test split:
# K-Fold Cross-Validation
scores = cross_val_score(model, X, y, cv=5)  # 5 folds

print(f"Accuracy: {scores.mean():.2f} (+/- {scores.std():.2f})")

# If all folds perform similarly: Good!
# If scores vary widely: Overfitting to specific split
```

**[PLACEHOLDER FOR CROSS-VALIDATION DIAGRAM]**  
*Show 5-fold cross-validation:*
- *Data split into 5 parts*
- *5 iterations, each using different part as test*
- *Average results*

---

#### Solution 5: Early Stopping

**Stop training before overfitting begins**

```python
from tensorflow.keras.callbacks import EarlyStopping

# Monitor validation loss
early_stop = EarlyStopping(
    monitor='val_loss',
    patience=10,  # Stop if no improvement for 10 epochs
    restore_best_weights=True
)

model.fit(X_train, y_train, 
          validation_data=(X_val, y_val),
          epochs=1000,  # Will stop early
          callbacks=[early_stop])
```

**[PLACEHOLDER FOR EARLY STOPPING GRAPH]**  
*Line graph showing:*
- *X-axis: Training epochs*
- *Y-axis: Loss*
- *Two lines: Training loss (decreasing) and Validation loss (decreases then increases)*
- *Mark optimal stopping point before validation loss increases*

---

#### Solution 6: Data Augmentation

**Create more training data artificially**

```python
# For images: rotate, flip, zoom, crop
# Increases dataset size ‚Üí Reduces overfitting
```

---

#### Solution 7: Ensemble Methods

**Combine multiple models**

```python
from sklearn.ensemble import RandomForestClassifier

# Random Forest = Ensemble of decision trees
# Each tree overfits differently
# Average predictions ‚Üí Reduces overfitting

forest = RandomForestClassifier(n_estimators=100)
```

---

## 7. Underfitting

### The Problem

**Model is TOO simple to capture underlying patterns.**

**Analogy**: Student who barely studied and doesn't understand concepts.
- Fails practice exam (training data)
- Fails real exam (test data)

```
Training Accuracy: 60% ‚úó
Test Accuracy: 58% ‚úó

Problem: Underfitting!
```

**[PLACEHOLDER FOR UNDERFITTING VISUALIZATION]**  
*Two graphs side-by-side:*
- *Left: Training data with straight line missing obvious patterns*
- *Right: Test data with same line also performing poorly*
- *Show: Model too simple to capture patterns*

---

### Signs of Underfitting

```python
# Red flags:
‚úó Low training accuracy
‚úó Low test accuracy  
‚úó Training and test accuracy similar (both bad)
‚úó Model predictions don't vary much
‚úó Very simple model
```

---

### Causes of Underfitting

1. **Model too simple** for problem complexity
   - Linear model for non-linear relationship
   - Shallow neural network for complex task

### Solutions for Underfitting

#### Solution 1: Use More Complex Model

```python
# From Linear to Polynomial
from sklearn.preprocessing import PolynomialFeatures

poly = PolynomialFeatures(degree=3)
X_poly = poly.fit_transform(X)
model.fit(X_poly, y)

# Or use more complex model
from sklearn.ensemble import RandomForestRegressor
model = RandomForestRegressor()  # Instead of LinearRegression
```

---

#### Solution 2: Add More Features

```python
# Feature engineering
# Create interaction features
df['size_x_location'] = df['size'] * df['location_score']

# Add polynomial features
# Add domain-specific features
```

---

#### Solution 3: Reduce Regularization

```python
# If using regularization, reduce strength
model = Ridge(alpha=0.001)  # Instead of alpha=10.0
```

---

#### Solution 4: Train Longer

```python
# Increase epochs
model.fit(X_train, y_train, epochs=200)  # Instead of epochs=10
```

## Overfitting vs Underfitting: The Bias-Variance Trade-off

**[PLACEHOLDER FOR BIAS-VARIANCE DIAGRAM]**  
*Create a U-shaped curve:*
- *X-axis: Model Complexity (simple ‚Üí complex)*
- *Y-axis: Error*
- *Three curves: Training Error, Test Error, Total Error*
- *Mark: Underfitting zone (left), Sweet spot (middle), Overfitting zone (right)*

### The Balance

| | Underfitting | Sweet Spot | Overfitting |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Training Error** | High | Low | Very Low |
| **Test Error** | High | Low | High |
| **Model Complexity** | Too Simple | Just Right | Too Complex |
| **Bias** | High | Balanced | Low |
| **Variance** | Low | Balanced | High |
| **Solution** | Increase complexity | Perfect! | Reduce complexity |

- Messy, streaming data
- 24/7 availability required
```

---

#### 8.2 Model Serving

**How to make predictions in production?**

**Options**:

1. **Batch Predictions**
   ```
   Daily: Load model, process all records, save predictions
   Use case: Email recommendations
   ```

2. **Real-Time API**
   ```
   User request ‚Üí API ‚Üí Model ‚Üí Prediction ‚Üí Response
   Use case: Fraud detection
   ```

3. **Edge Deployment**
   ```
   Model runs on device (phone, IoT)
   Use case: Face unlock
   ```

---

#### 8.3 Model Versioning

```
Problems:
- Multiple model versions in production
- Which version made this prediction?
- How to rollback if new model fails?

Solutions:

‚Üí Model Training ‚Üí Model Evaluation ‚Üí Model Deployment 
‚Üí Monitoring ‚Üí (loop back to data collection)

All must be automated!
```

---

### Solutions for Deployment

```python
# Example: Deploy with Flask API
from flask import Flask, request, jsonify
import pickle

app = Flask(__name__)

# Load model once at startup
with open('model.pkl', 'rb') as f:
    model = pickle.load(f)

@app.route('/predict', methods=['POST'])
def predict():
    data = request.get_json()
    features = extract_features(data)
    prediction = model.predict([features])
    return jsonify({'prediction': int(prediction[0])})

if __name__ == '__main__':
    app.run(host='0.0.0.0', port=5000)
```

## üß† Quick Quiz

1. What's the difference between overfitting and underfitting?
2. Name three ways to handle missing data.
3. What is sampling bias and why is it problematic?
4. How can you detect if your model is overfitting?
5. What is feature engineering and why is it important?

<details>
<summary>Click for answers</summary>

1. Overfitting: Model too complex, memorizes training data, poor generalization. Underfitting: Model too simple, can't capture patterns, poor on all data.
2. (Any three) Remove rows, Remove columns, Impute with mean/median/mode, Forward/backward fill, KNN imputation, Use algorithms that handle missing values.
3. Sampling bias: Training data systematically excludes or over-represents certain groups. Problematic because model performs poorly on underrepresented groups in real world.
4. Training accuracy much higher than test accuracy, Validation loss increases while training loss decreases, Model performs well on old data but poorly on new data.
5. Feature engineering: Creating, selecting, and transforming features to improve model performance. Important because right features are often more important than choice of algorithm - "garbage in, garbage out."
