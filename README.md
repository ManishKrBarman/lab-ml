# 🤖 Machine Learning Learning Journey

- A comprehensive guide to Machine Learning - from beginner to advanced concepts.
- The diagrams and graps are still pending to add and will be added in the next push.
- This docs are **made by agents** from a raw file which includes my own points and learning. I **will not share** that doc publicly and is only made for my personal use.
- Although I have checked every docs well, if you find any mistake, please contact me.
